- we can observe my top 5 expenses throughout the year

- Avearge Monthly Balance is fluctuating over the whole year

- We can observe that income and expense are almost equal in all months

- During day of week mostly transactions happened on Friday 

- I have analysed my top 5 deposited Amount

- Using Net cash flow we can interpret that only during January, August and Septembermonth amount is deposited and during all other months there is only expense

- Here Positive savings in Months January, April, August, September, and November indicate that I have surplus income

- Negative savings in Months February, March, May, June, July, October, and December indicate that I have spent more than earned during those months
